## data-driven distance metric (DDDM) for Person Re-identification

Demo code for [Zero-Shot Person Re-identification via Cross-View Consistency](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7346474/) in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia.

The core code is in *calcMCMC2.m*. 
You can change *K*, *alpha*, *beta* for different datasets.
Run *adaptation.m* directly to evaluate the method, and you can choose different datasets and evaluate methods.
